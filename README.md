# Challenges 

Hello!


This is just me having fun by solving interesting coding questions when I have free time. There are some pretty cool questions so I wanted to share my solutions too!

Here are the questions I worked on so far:

2. Find the sum of two numbers each represented as a linked list in reverse order of digits.
3. Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
1213. Given 3 sorted arrays, output the common elements of all 3 arrays.
