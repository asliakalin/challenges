# Challenges 

Hello World!
This is my code challenge project, a collection of all interesting questions I encountered along with my solutions and testing.
Here are the questions I worked on so far along with the directories they are kept in.
1. leet1: Two Sums, Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
2. dcp1: sumsK, Given an array of numbers, return whether any two sums to K.
3. dcp2: productI, Given an array of integers,return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i in O(n) time and without using division.
